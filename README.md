# Simple OS Project
CSYE-6230 OS Project

Our project undertakes the ambitious task of designing an operating system from the ground up, guiding you through the essential phases of OS development with a focus on practical, real-world functionality. Beginning with the creation of a boot sector, we swiftly progress to enabling 32-bit mode and transition from the raw power of assembly to the versatility of C. As we delve deeper, we grapple with managing interrupts and facilitating user interactions via screen output and keyboard input. Central to our operating system are the fundamental commands that govern file manipulation—copy, paste, move, delete, and rename—each interwoven with key OS concepts such as the file system, I/O management, process management, and memory management. Our curriculum ensures an understanding of the dual modes of operation—kernel and user—and underscores the significance of privilege levels that safeguard system integrity. Through the use of system calls, we illustrate how the OS interfaces with hardware, enabling these essential file operations. This project not only equips you with the theoretical underpinnings but also immerses you in the practicalities of OS design, providing a comprehensive learning experience.
