# Simple OS Project
CSYE-6230 OS Project

This OS development tutorial is a hands-on guide designed for programmers who are intrigued by the workings of an operating system but lack the time or energy to delve into complex kernels like Linux. Unlike traditional courses laden with theoretical content, this tutorial emphasizes practical, step-by-step learning with minimal theoretical explanations. Its structure is straightforward: starting from creating a boot sector from scratch, it progresses through enabling 32-bit mode, transitioning from assembly to C, handling interrupts, and managing screen output and keyboard input. The course also introduces a basic libc tailored to the project's needs and lays the groundwork for more advanced features such as memory management, filesystem creation, a simple shell, user mode, and potentially a text editor, process scheduling, a BASIC interpreter, a graphical user interface, and networking. Each lesson is concise, taking approximately 5-15 minutes to complete, and is complemented by highly commented code examples to reinforce understanding. Participants are encouraged to experiment with the code to deepen their comprehension. This project is an excellent starting point for those looking to demystify OS development through a practical, coding-first approach.

Set-up:
Install brew tool by typing "brew install" to install brew first and run "brew install qemu nasm" in CMD.
